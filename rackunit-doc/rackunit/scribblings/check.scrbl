@title{Checks}

Checks are the basic building block of RackUnit.  A check
checks some condition and always
evaluates to @racket[(void)].  If the condition doesn't hold, the
check will report the failure using the current @tech{check-info stack}
(see @racket[current-check-handler] for customizing how failures are handled).

Although checks are implemented as macros, which is
necessary to grab source locations (see @secref{rackunit:custom-checks}), they are conceptually
functions (with the exception of @racket[check-match] below).
This means, for instance, checks always evaluate
their arguments.  You can use a check as a first class
function, though this will affect the source location that the check grabs.


@section[#:tag "rackunit:basic-checks"]{Basic Checks}

The following are the basic checks RackUnit provides.  You
can create your own checks using @racket[define-check].

@defproc*[([(check-eq? (v1 any) (v2 any) (message (or/c string? #f) #f)) void?]
           [(check-not-eq? (v1 any) (v2 any) (message (or/c string? #f) #f)) void?]
           [(check-eqv? (v1 any) (v2 any) (message (or/c string? #f) #f)) void?]
           [(check-not-eqv? (v1 any) (v2 any) (message (or/c string? #f) #f)) void?]
           [(check-equal? (v1 any) (v2 any) (message (or/c string? #f) #f)) void?]
           [(check-not-equal? (v1 any) (v2 any) (message (or/c string? #f) #f)) void?])]{

Checks that @racket[v1] is equal (or not equal) to @racket[v2], using
@racket[eq?], @racket[eqv?], or @racket[equal?], respectively. The
optional @racket[message] is included in the output if the check
fails.

For example, the following checks all fail:

@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
  (check-eq? (list 1) (list 1) "allocated data not eq?")
  (check-not-eq? 1 1 "fixnums are eq?")
  (check-eqv? 1 1.0 "not eqv?")
  (check-not-eqv? 1 1 "integers are eqv?")
  (check-equal? 1 1.0 "not equal?")
  (check-not-equal? (list 1) (list 1) "equal?")
]
}

@defproc[(check-pred (pred (-> any any)) (v any) (message (or/c string? #f) #f))
         void?]{

Checks that @racket[pred] returns a value that is not @racket[#f] when
applied to @racket[v].  The optional @racket[message] is included in
the output if the check fails. The value returned by a successful
check is the value returned by @racket[pred].

For example, the following check passes:
@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
  (check-pred string? "I work")
]
The following check fails:
@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
  (check-pred number? "I fail")
]
}

@defproc[(check-= (v1 number?) (v2 number?) (epsilon number?) (message (or/c string? #f) #f))
         void?]{

Checks that @racket[v1] and @racket[v2] are numbers within
@racket[epsilon] of one another.  The optional
@racket[message] is included in the output if the check
fails.

For example, the following check passes:

@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
  (check-= 1.0 1.01 0.02 "I work")
]
The following check fails:
@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
  (check-= 1.0 1.01 0.005 "I fail")
]
}

@defproc[(check-within [v1 any] [v2 any] [epsilon number?] [message (or/c string? #f) #f])
         void?]{

Checks that @racket[v1] and @racket[v2] are @racket[equal?] to each
other, while allowing numbers @italic{inside} of them to be different by
at most @racket[epsilon] from one another. If @racket[(equal? v1 v2)] would
call @racket[equal?] on sub-pieces that are numbers, then those numbers are
considered "good enough" if they're within @racket[epsilon].

For example, the following checks pass:

@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
  (check-within (list 6 10) (list 6.02 9.99) 0.05)
  (check-within (flvector 3.0 4.0 5.0) (flvector 3.01 4.01 5.014) 0.02)
  (check-within (hash 'C 20 'F 68) (hash 'C 25 'F 77) 10)
]
And the following checks fail:
@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
  (check-within (list 6.0e23 10.0) (list 6.02e23 9.8) 0.05)
  (check-within (hash 'C 18 'F 64) (hash 'C 25 'F 77) 10)
]
}

@defproc*[([(check-true (v any) (message (or/c string? #f) #f)) void?]
           [(check-false (v any) (message (or/c string? #f) #f)) void?]
           [(check-not-false (v any) (message (or/c string? #f) #f)) void?])]{

Checks that @racket[v] is @racket[#t], is @racket[#f], or is not
@racket[#f], respectively.  The optional @racket[message] is included
in the output if the check fails.

For example, the following checks all fail:

@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
  (check-true 1)
  (check-false 1)
  (check-not-false #f)
]
}

@defproc[(check-exn (exn-predicate (or/c (-> any any/c) regexp?))
                    (thunk (-> any)) (message (or/c string? #f) #f))
         void?]{

Checks that @racket[thunk] raises an exception and that either
@racket[exn-predicate] returns a true value if it is a function, or
that it matches the message in the exception if @racket[exn-predicate]
is a regexp. In the latter case, the exception raised must be an
@racket[exn:fail?].  The optional @racket[message] is included in the
output if the check fails.  A common error is to use an expression
instead of a function of no arguments for @racket[thunk].  Remember
that checks are conceptually functions.

For example, the following checks succeed:

@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
  (check-exn
   exn:fail?
   (lambda ()
     (raise (make-exn:fail "Hi there"
                           (current-continuation-marks)))))
  (check-exn
   exn:fail?
   (lambda ()
     (error 'hi "there")))
]

The following check fails:

@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
  (check-exn exn:fail?
             (lambda ()
               (break-thread (current-thread))))
]

The following example is a common mistake. The call to @racket[error]
is not within a @racket[lambda], so it bypasses @racket[check-exn]
entirely.

@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
  (code:comment "Forgot to wrap the expression in a thunk.  Don't do this!")
  (check-exn exn:fail?
             (error 'hi "there"))
]
}

@defproc[(check-not-exn (thunk (-> any)) (message (or/c string? #f) #f)) void?]{

Checks that @racket[thunk] does not raise any exceptions.
The optional @racket[message] is included in the output if
the check fails.

@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
                    (check-not-exn (λ () 1))
                    (check-not-exn (λ () (car '())))
                    (check-not-exn (λ () (/ 1 0)) "don't divide by 0")]

}

@defproc[(check-regexp-match (regexp regexp?)
                             (string string?))
         void?]{

Checks that @racket[regexp] matches the @racket[string].


For example, the following check succeeds:

@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
  (check-regexp-match "a+bba" "aaaaaabba")
]

The following check fails:

@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
  (check-regexp-match "a+bba" "aaaabbba")
]
}

@defform*[((check-match v pattern)
           (check-match v pattern pred))]{

A check that pattern matches on the test value.  Matches the test value
@racket[v] against @racket[pattern] as a @racket[match] clause.  If no
@racket[pred] is provided, then if the match succeeds, the entire check
succeeds.  For example, this use succeeds:

@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
  (check-match (list 1 2 3) (list _ _ 3))
]

This check fails to match:

@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
  (check-match (list 1 2 3) (list _ _ 4))
]

If @racket[pred] is provided, it is evaluated with the bindings from the
match pattern.  If it produces @racket[#t], the entire check succeeds,
otherwise it fails.  For example, this use succeeds, binding @racket[x]
in the predicate:

@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
  (check-match (list 1 (list 3)) (list x (list _)) (odd? x))
]

This check fails because the @racket[pred] fails:

@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
  (check-match 6 x (odd? x))
]

This check fails because of a failure to match:

@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
  (check-match (list 1 2) (list x) (odd? x))
]

}


@defproc[(check (op (-> any any any))
                (v1 any)
                (v2 any)
                (message (or/c string? #f) #f))
         void?]{

The most generic check.  Succeeds if @racket[op] applied to
@racket[v1] and @racket[v2] is not @racket[#f], otherwise raises an
exception of type @racket[exn:test:check].  The optional
@racket[message] is included in the output if the check fails.

For example, the following check succeeds:

@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
  (check < 2 3)
]

The following check fails:

@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
  (check memq 'pine '(apple orange pear))
]
}

@defproc[(fail (message (or/c string? #f) #f))
         void?]{

This check fails unconditionally.  Good for creating test stubs that
you intend to fill out later.  The optional @racket[message] is
included in the output.
}

@section{Augmenting Information on Check Failure}

When a check fails, it may add @tech[#:key "check-info"]{information} about
the failure to RackUnit's @tech{check-info stack}.
Additional information can be stored by using the @racket[with-check-info*]
function, and the @racket[with-check-info] macro.

@defstruct[check-info ([name symbol?] [value any]) #:transparent]{
 A @deftech[#:key "check-info"]{check-info structure} stores information
 associated with the context of the execution of a check. The @racket[value]
 is normally written in a check failure message using @racket[write], but the
 @racketmodname[rackunit] library provides several special formatting wrappers
 that can influence how the check info value is printed.

 @history[#:changed "1.6" "Changed from opaque to transparent"]}

@defstruct*[string-info ([value string?]) #:transparent]{
 A special wrapper around a string for use as a @tech{check-info} value. When
 displayed in a check failure message, @racket[value] is displayed without
 quotes. Used to print messages instead of writing values.

 @(interaction
   #:eval rackunit-eval
   (define-check (string-info-check)
     (with-check-info (['value "hello world"]
                       ['message (string-info "hello world")])
       (fail-check)))
   (string-info-check))

 @history[#:added "1.2"]}

@defstruct*[nested-info ([values (listof check-info?)]) #:transparent]{
 A special wrapper around a list of @tech{check-infos} for use as a
 @racket[check-info] value. A check info whose value is a nested info is
 displayed as an indented subsequence of infos. Nested infos can be placed
 inside nested infos, yielding greater indentation.

 @(interaction
   #:eval rackunit-eval
   (define-check (nested-info-check)
     (define infos
       (list (make-check-info 'foo "foo") (make-check-info 'bar "bar")))
     (with-check-info (['nested (nested-info infos)]) (fail-check)))
   (nested-info-check))

 @history[#:added "1.7"]}

@defstruct*[dynamic-info ([proc (-> any/c)]) #:transparent]{
 A special wrapper around a procedure that produces a value for a
 @tech{check-info}. When a @racket[dynamic-info] is displayed in a check info
 stack, @racket[proc] is called to determine what value to display.

 @(interaction
   #:eval rackunit-eval
   (with-check-info (['current-dir (dynamic-info current-directory)])
     (check-equal? 1 2)
     (parameterize ([current-directory (find-system-path 'temp-dir)])
       (check-equal? 1 2))))

 The value returned by @racket[proc] may itself be a special formatting value
 such as @racket[nested-info] (or even another @racket[dynamic-info]), in which
 case that value is rendered as it would be if it had not been wrapped in
 @racket[dynamic-info].

 @(interaction
   #:eval rackunit-eval
   (define current-foo (make-parameter #f))
   (with-check-info (['foo (dynamic-info current-foo)])
     (check-equal? 1 2)
     (parameterize ([current-foo
                     (nested-info (list (make-check-info 'nested 'foo)))])
       (check-equal? 1 2))))

 @history[#:added "1.9"]}

The are several predefined functions that create @tech{check-info}
structures with predefined names.  This avoids
misspelling errors:

@defproc*[([(make-check-name (name string?)) check-info?]
           [(make-check-params (params (listof any))) check-info?]
           [(make-check-location (loc (list/c any (or/c number? #f) (or/c number? #f)
                                                  (or/c number? #f) (or/c number? #f))))
            check-info?]
           [(make-check-expression (msg any)) check-info?]
           [(make-check-message (msg string?)) check-info?]
           [(make-check-actual (param any)) check-info?]
           [(make-check-expected (param any)) check-info?])]{}

@defproc[(with-check-info* (info (listof check-info?)) (thunk (-> any))) any]{

Pushes the given @racket[info] on the @tech{check-info stack} for
the duration (the dynamic extent) of the execution of
@racket[thunk]}

@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
  (with-check-info*
   (list (make-check-info 'time (current-seconds)))
   (lambda () (check = 1 2)))
]

When this check fails the message

@verbatim{time: <current-seconds-at-time-of-running-check>}

is printed along with the usual information on an check failure.

@defform[(with-check-info ((name val) ...) body ...)]{

The @racket[with-check-info] macro pushes the given
information onto the @tech{check-info stack} for the duration
of the execution of the body expressions. Each @racket[name] must be
a quoted symbol and each @racket[val] must be a value.}

@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
 (for-each
  (lambda (elt)
    (with-check-info
     (('current-element elt))
     (check-pred odd? elt)))
  (list 1 3 5 7 8))
]

When this test fails the message

@verbatim{current-element: 8}

is displayed along with the usual information on an check failure.


@defproc[(with-default-check-info* (info (listof check-info?)) (thunk (-> any))) any]{

Similar to @racket[with-check-info*], but ignores elements of @racket[info]
 whose name (as determined by @racket[check-info-name]) matches the name
 of an element on the current @tech{check-info stack}.

@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
  (with-default-check-info*
    (list (make-check-name 'first-name))
    (λ ()
      (with-default-check-info*
        (list (make-check-name 'last-name))
        (λ ()
          (check-true #false)))))]

The error message above should include @racket['first-name] but not
 @racket['last-name].
}

@section[#:tag "rackunit:custom-checks"]{Custom Checks}

Custom checks can be defined using @racket[define-check] and
its variants.  To effectively use these macros it is useful
to understand a few details about a check's evaluation
model.

First, a check should be considered a function, even
though most uses are actually macros.  In particular, checks
always evaluate their arguments exactly once before
executing any expressions in the body of the checks.  Hence
if you wish to write checks that evaluate user defined code
that code must be wrapped in a thunk (a function of no
arguments) by the user.  The predefined @racket[check-exn]
is an example of this type of check.

Second, checks add information to the @deftech{check-info stack}:
an internal list of @tech{check-info} structures that RackUnit interprets to
build error messages.
The @seclink["rackunit:basic-checks"]{basic checks} treat the stack as a
source of optional arguments; if the stack is missing some information, then
the check may supply a default value.
For example, @racket[check-equal?] adds a default source location if the
@tech{check-info stack} does not contain a @tech{check-info} with the name
@racket['location] (see @racket[make-check-location]).


@defform[(define-simple-check (name param ...) body ...)]{

The @racket[define-simple-check] macro constructs a check
called @racket[name] that takes the params and an optional
message as arguments and evaluates the @racket[body]s.  The
check fails if the result of the last @racket[body] is
@racket[#f].  Otherwise the check succeeds.

Simple checks cannot report extra information by using
@racket[with-check-info] inside their @racket[body].}

For example, the following code defines a check @racket[check-odd?]

@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
  (define-simple-check (check-odd? number)
    (odd? number))
]

We can use these checks in the usual way:

@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
  (check-odd? 3)
  (check-odd? 2)
]

@defform*[[(define-binary-check (name pred actual expected))
          (define-binary-check (name actual expected) body ...)]]{

The @racket[define-binary-check] macro constructs a check
that tests a binary predicate.
It adds the values of @racket[actual] and @racket[expected] to the
 @tech{check-info stack}.
The first form of @racket[define-binary-check] accepts a binary
predicate and tests if the predicate holds for the given
values.  The second form tests if the last @racket[body]
evaluates to a non-false value.
}

Here's the first form, where we use a predefined predicate
to construct a binary check:

@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
  (define-binary-check (check-char=? char=? actual expected))
]

In use:

@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
  (check-char=? (read-char (open-input-string "a")) #\a)
]

If the expression is more complicated, the second form should
be used.  For example, below we define a binary check that
tests whether a number is within 0.01 of the expected value:

@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
  (define-binary-check (check-in-tolerance actual expected)
    (< (abs (- actual expected)) 0.01))
]

@defform[(define-check (name param ...) body ...)]{

The @racket[define-check] macro is similar to
@racket[define-simple-check], except the check only fails
if @racket[fail-check] is called in the body of the check.
This allows more flexible checks, and in particular more flexible
reporting options.

@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
  (define-check (check-even? number)
    (unless (even? number)
      (fail-check)))

  (check-even? 0)
  (check-even? 1)
]

Checks defined with @racket[define-check] add the source location and source
 syntax at their use-site to the @tech{check-info stack}, unless the stack
 already contains values for the keys @racket['location] and @racket['expression].

@interaction[#:eval rackunit-eval
  (check-equal? 0 1)
  (with-check-info*
    (list (make-check-location (list 'custom 6 1 #f #f)))
    (λ () (check-equal? 0 1)))
]

 @history[#:changed "1.9" @elem{Documented the protocol for adding @racket['location] and @racket['expression] information.}]
}

@defproc[(fail-check [message string?]) void?]{
Raises an @racket[exn:test:check] with the contents of the @tech{check-info stack}.
The optional message is used as the exception's
message.}

@close-eval[rackunit-eval]
